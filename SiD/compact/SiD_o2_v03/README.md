Version #3 of the SiD option #2 model, with corresponding drivers making use of the new TrackingCellIDEncoding string.

To do:
- clean up all XMLs
- make sure encoding is the the same across all Tracking + Vertex detectors
- add type_flags where missing
- add envelopes where missing
- create common barrel+endcap envelopes 
- update or rewrite the corresponding barrel and endcap drivers (and allow 2 sensitive slices)
